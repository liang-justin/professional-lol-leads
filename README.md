## Introduction and Question Identification

League of Legends (LOL) is a popular MOBA that is played by many people around the world. Like other sports like basketball, football, soccer, etc. it can be enjoyed casually and even professionally in the form of League of Legends Esports. Like the many professional leagues for sports, League of Legends Esports is a collection of the best players and teams in the world which compete to lift the Summoner's Cup. Split into the region that they are found in (ie. Americas, Europle, Korea), the teams in each region duke it out with one another to determine which team(s) are most fit to represent the region at international events. With its large increase in popularity, fans, both serious and casual, are able to tune in to these matches and see their favorite teams and players parttake in such events. In a similar fashion to other sports leagues, many of the important events and statistics in each match are documented for those to see and understand. Information such as gold earned, xp gained, CS, etc. can help us viewers understand the current climate of the game and provide insight to who might be victorious at the end. This information is not only valuable to the viewer, but can also be valueable to the players and teams on ways to improve in the future.

In the dataset organized by OraclesElixir, match data across all regions in the 2022 professional LOL esports season were collected. Within this dataset, match data information regarding the who: the team that played, which players, which patch; the what: in-game statistics such as which champions were picked, champions that were banned, which side, game statistics - gold, xp, dragon kills, baron kills,etc.; and the the outcome of the match are organized in a readable format. We hope to use this dataset to explore some deeper intricacies into professional LOL. This dataset contains 149400 rows and 123 columns - with the rows grouped into 12 row groups: 10 rows of player information and 2 rows of team information.

In regular League of Legend matches, players are given the opportunity to play the match for 15 minutes before given the opportunity to forfeit (ff). At this point of the game, players are usually able to determine the feasibility of playing the rest of the match as early action is common up to this point of the game. Unlike regular matches, players in professional matches are not given this liberty of forfeitting due to extraneous reasons. However, with this in mind, we hope to analyze how a lead (specifically in gold **and** xp) might contribute to which team is victorious at the end of the match a.k.a. keeping a lead.

As there are many unnecessary columns in this dataset, we only are interested in the columns that contain the statistics relevant to our analysis of this question, which can be summarized below.

| Column | Description |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| gameid | Unique identifier for each match played |
| datacompleteness | Describes if all applicable columns entries are filled for each row|
| url | Website for information regarding the match played, commonly only found for rows which data is incomplete |
| side | One team plays on the Blue Side of the map, the other on the Red Side. There are differences to the side, but not important for this analysis|
| teamname | The name of the team that is playing |
| gamelength | The duration of the game (in seconds) |
| totalgold | Total Gold that is earned by the player/team from cs-ing, kills (towers, enemies, neutral mobs, etc.), etc.|

| csat15 | Total CS that by the player/team from killing enemy minions |
| golddiffat15 | The differential between the Team Gold Earned at the 15 minute mark |
| xpdiffat15 | The differential between the Team Experience Earned at the 15 minute mark |
| csdiffat15 | The differential between the Team CS Earned at the 15 minute mark |
| killsat15 | The total number of enemy champion kills at the 15 minute mark (player deals the final damage) |
| assistsat15 | The total number of enemy champion assists at the 15 minute mark (player assists on the damaging of the enemy) |

When looking down the rows of the dataset, we see that there are 12 rows that correspond to each official match that was played. The first 10 columns summarize the game statistics for each player - 5 players on each team times two. The remaining two columns contain the aggregate game statistic for each team, which are the rows that we are interested in. We will drop other rows in favor of keeping these rows. 

Furthermore, the dataset also contains many extraneous information regarding the matches such as information regarding the patch that was played on, dragons killed, who killed the first dragon, etc.. The information that is found in these columns are not relevant in this analysis and were also dropped in favor of keeping the columns as described above.

After the pruning of the unnecessary rows and columns, the remaining columns do contain some data in incorrect form, namely 'result' which contain boolean values in the form of 0's and 1's which is somewhat hard to understand at a glance. To fix this, the datatype was converted from type int to type boolean.

As the remaining data is already cleaned, the dataset is now much smaller in size as seen below. Even though there remains some columns which contain NaN values, their importance/unimportance will be discussed later in this analysis.

The kills/assist of each game up to the first 15 minutes can also give us insight to how large the lead might be, so we will sum their columns and enter them into an additional column.

### Univariate Analysis

#### Gold is King! or is it...

Spawning into the game at 0:00, most of the "action" that happens after the ~1:30 minute mark. Especially in professional games where the players are the best of the best, in many of the games there might be little to no action until the later stages of the game after champions "come online" with full-item purchases. We hope to visualize what types of gold leads there are and at what frequency to give us some insight to the game state at the 15 minute mark.

From this histogram, it is clearly evident that most professional games that were played in 2022 were relatively "close" in the sense of gold leads. The left skew of the data provides some information to the game state up to that point as many of the core components of the early game of each match revolve around getting gold efficiently and quick - kills being worth 300 gold, cs-ing, assist kills (range from 75-150 gold), or even just being "bullied" (not being able to cs) in lane. These leads that are generated based on gold are not monumental for the 15 minute mark and are definitely possible to overcome from the 15 minute mark until the end of the match.

#### What about XP?

Gold Differential doesn't always tell the best story in League of Legends. Experience or 'xp' can also serve as a tell-tale sign of a lead in matches. CS-ing, kills, dragon kills all give xp to champions. Once the champion obtains a set number of  experience points, they can level up abilities, giving players more options/opportunities to play to the strengths of the champion which they have chosen. This was further explored in the histogram below.

Interesting! The spread of the XP differentials at the 15 minute mark is very similar to the Gold differentials graph. As stated earlier, since kills, CS-ing, dragon kills all provide xp to champions, they also provide champions that were involved gold as well. This might point to a positive relationship between gold earned and xp earned.

### Bivariate Analysis

That's interesting, there seems to be a general linear relationship between the gold differential at the 15 minute mark and the xp differential. Like what was said earlier, these two statistics help to paint a better picture of the climate of the game at this point. Even though certain champions are strong by themselves even in a deficit, a lead in both xp and gold is something an enemy champ doesn't want to see in a head to head, or even in a team fight.

### Pivot Table

| result   |   ('mean', 'golddiffat15') |   ('mean', 'killassisttotal15') |   ('mean', 'xpdiffat15') |   ('median', 'golddiffat15') |   ('median', 'killassisttotal15') |   ('median', 'xpdiffat15') |
|:---------|---------------------------:|--------------------------------:|-------------------------:|-----------------------------:|----------------------------------:|---------------------------:|
| False    |                   -1724.2  |                         7.20358 |                 -1032.87 |                        -1551 |                                 6 |                       -926 |
| True     |                    1724.85 |                        11.0047  |                  1033.26 |                         1551 |                                10 |                        927 |

This pivot table provides some general information on the conditions of the teams find themselves in at the 15 minute mark in relation to the outcome of the match. It is generall seen that a result of a win (True) usually points toward a lead at the 15 minute mark across all three of the columns of interest. This provides us with some context to how professional players are able to leverage these leads to snowball into a win. It is seen that both the mean and the median value of these conditions share similar sentiments.

## Assessment of Missingness

#### NMAR Analysis
Columns such as information regarding some of the differentials ('goldat10', 'xpat10', etc.) could be considered to be NMAR. This is because if the data is sorted by region (LPL, LCK, LCS, LEC, etc.) we see that the data that is missing here is dependent on itself since some regions might be uninclined to take these measurements while others do. It might also be down to the actual data retrieval as it is impossible to watch every single match and note down every single bit of information as there are many matches going on across the world (as seen by the large number of matches completed). To determine the missingness I think it would be nice to see why these certain regions are not collecting this information while others are. Looking at the 'partial' responses in the 'datacompleteness' column, we see that many of the matches that have this information missing also include a url to a place where the information was retrieved from. Maybe these regions might want to report on more meaningful information, as seen with the other columns, rather than worry about the gold differential, xp differential, etc. at 10 minutes and 15 minutes.
